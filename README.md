# Составление индекса для текстового файла

```
gradle run --args="-i <inputFile> [-o <outputFile>] <command>
```

Default output file is `data/result.txt`
 
Supported commands:

* `index` generates the index of file `inputFile` containing some text in Russian and writes representation of the index to `outputFile`. For all other commands `inputFile` should contain the index generated by this command.
* `common <number>` prints `number` most frequent words in the text in descending order of occurrences. Each line in
 the output is `<word>: <occurrences>`. Different forms of the same lexeme are treated as its lemma (using www.odict.ru).
 * `group <words>` prints information about usage of words from semantic categories described by each of `words`. RuWordNet thesaurus is used to obtain relations between words.
 
 Output format for each group:
 ```
<group>: total <number> occurrences
  <word1>: <number> occurrences
  <word2>: <number> occurrences
  ...
```
* `info <words>` analyzes usage of each of `words`.  Output format for each word:
```
<word>: <number> occurrences
used forms: <form1>, <form2>, ...
found on pages: <page1>, <page2>, ...
```
* `lines <words>` for every word in `words` prints all lines where some form of the word occurs. Output format:
```
word:
<number1>: <line1>
<number2>: <line2>
...
```
